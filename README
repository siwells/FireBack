There is something wrong on the Internet... and I need to respond, to point out just how wrong it is. 

Whilst browsing the web we often discover things that we disagree with and feel the desire to respond. However our responses are often confined to the feedback mechanisms that are provided by the site with which we are disagreeing, potenitally leading to disemvowelling or comment deletion. FireBack is a tool whose core funcion is to bring put argumentative dialogue at the core of your browsing experience. 

The web, and arguably the wider Internet, is a tool for communication, for dialogue, and for argument. The web was originally conceived as a two way communication tool supporting dialogue and argumentative expression, but it hasn't worked out that way.
